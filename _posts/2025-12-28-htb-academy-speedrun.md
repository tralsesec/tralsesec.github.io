**MISSION DEBRIEF:** 100% Completion of HTB Academy CPTS & CWES Paths.

After an intense 4-week sprint—roughly 200-250 hours—I completed Hack The Box Academy’s Web Penetration Tester (CWES) and Penetration Tester (CPTS) paths. Together, they cover over 800,000 words of offensive security content, plus countless hands-on labs. 

### 🏗️ Architecture over Tooling
The curriculum emphasizes protocol behavior and trust boundaries over simple tool usage. You learn not just how to exploit something, but **why** it fails.

### ⚖️ Difficulty & Methodology
The challenge isn’t CTF trickery, but disciplined enumeration and maintaining a clean methodology across long attack chains. Labs reward structure and consistency while penalizing randomness.

### 🧠 Learning at Speed: Tactics
To scale at this pace (12–14 hour days), structure beats memorization:
* **Concept First:** Understand the attack path before the command.
* **Selective AI:** Used Gemini Pro to distill dense sections and maintain focus on decision-making.
* **Active Inquiry:** Constantly questioning the "why" behind tool capabilities to grow skills beyond the curriculum.

### 🏁 Verdict
HTB Academy defines a strong operational baseline. Completing both paths lays the foundation for advanced tracks like OSEP or CAPE.

**Next steps:** Pro Labs (Dante, Zephyr, POO, RastaLabs), methodology battle-testing, then the CPTS exam 💀.
